Catch exc' all
==============

This repo is part of my internship assignment at INRIA. Supervised by Fabrice Lefessant.
Basically it's a bundle of buggy .ml files aiming at finding statically exceptions that could get out of a program uncaught.

The idea is to remove higher order functions. Then do a 0-CFA.
Well, the first part is in progress. Have fun reading it.

If you don't have fun reading it, or if you have any question, don't hesitate and contact me !
